After Sergei Korolev convinced the politburo to save the stranded Apollo 10 astronauts, the world's major players managed to put their differences aside, turn their focus skyward, and launch the golden age of space exploration. But right as it seemed humanity might grow out of conflict, the earth went silent, and the pioneers of this new frontier realised there was only so much left to go around

REGOLITH is a multiplayer first-person shooter set on the moon in an alternate 1980s
